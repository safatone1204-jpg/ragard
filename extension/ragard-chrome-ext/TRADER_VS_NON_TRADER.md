# Trader vs Non-Trader: Which Should You Choose?

When registering for a Chrome Web Store developer account, you'll be asked if you're a **Trader** or **Non-Trader**. This is required by the European Union's Digital Services Act.

## Definitions

### **Trader**
You're acting **for purposes related to your trade, business, craft, or profession**.

Examples:
- ✅ You have a company/business
- ✅ You're making money from this (or plan to)
- ✅ This is part of your professional work
- ✅ You have a production website/business
- ✅ You're providing a commercial service

### **Non-Trader**
You're acting **for purposes outside your trade, business, craft, or profession** (personal/hobby project).

Examples:
- ✅ Open source hobby project
- ✅ Personal learning project
- ✅ Not making money from it
- ✅ Not related to your business/work
- ✅ Just sharing with friends/family

## Which One Are You?

Based on your Ragard project, you appear to be a **TRADER** because:

1. ✅ You have a production website: `ragardai.com`
2. ✅ You have a business/service (Ragard)
3. ✅ You're deploying to production
4. ✅ You're making it available to users
5. ✅ This appears to be a commercial product/service

**Recommendation: Choose "TRADER"**

## What Happens if You Choose "Trader"?

- You'll need to provide and verify:
  - Your legal name
  - Contact information (email, address)
  - This information will be **publicly displayed** on your extension's store listing
- This ensures transparency for consumers (required by EU law)
- Consumer protection laws apply

## What Happens if You Choose "Non-Trader"?

- Less information required
- Information may not be publicly displayed
- Consumer protection laws may not apply
- **BUT**: Only choose this if it's truly a personal hobby project

## Important: Be Honest

- Choose the category that **accurately reflects** your situation
- If you're unsure, it's safer to choose "Trader" if you have any business/commercial aspects
- Misclassifying can cause issues later

## For Ragard Specifically

Since Ragard is:
- A production website/service
- Being made available to users
- Appears to be a commercial product

**You should choose: TRADER**

This means your contact information will be visible on the Chrome Web Store listing, which is normal and expected for business products.

## Next Steps

1. Choose "Trader" when registering
2. Have ready:
   - Your legal name (or company name if registered)
   - Business/contact address
   - Email address
   - Phone number (may be optional)
3. Complete the verification process
4. Submit your extension

That's it! The process is straightforward once you know which category applies to you.
